## Data Collection Guidelines

### For Each Class:
1. **Vary sentence length** - short (2-4 words) to long (10+ words)
2. **Vary formality** - casual to formal
3. **Include typos/errors** - speech-to-text often has errors
4. **Include variations** - synonyms, word order changes
5. **Include edge cases** - unusual but valid inputs

### Sample Distribution (for 10,000 total samples):

| Class | Count | Percentage |
|-------|-------|------------|
| save | 1800 | 18% |
| search | 1800 | 18% |
| reminder | 2000 | 20% |
| cancel_all | 1200 | 12% |
| cancel_specific | 1600 | 16% |
| unclear | 1600 | 16% |

**Note:** `reminder` has slightly more due to more variations (time, recurring, etc.)
**Note:** `cancel_all` has fewer because it has limited natural variations

### Quality Checks:
1. No duplicate entries
2. Correct label assignment
3. Realistic voice input patterns
4. Balanced across sub-categories within each class
